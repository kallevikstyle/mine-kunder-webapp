# Mine Kunder – webapp

This is a small web application to search for businesses in the Norwegian entity registry, through an API provided by Brønnøysundregisteret. The user can store any company to his portfolio and add personal notes. 
The application is currently not connected to a database, and so the information is only stored for the current session.
